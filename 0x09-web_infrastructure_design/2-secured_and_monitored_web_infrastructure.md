Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure Overview
Overview
This web infrastructure consists of three servers that are secured and monitored, facilitating encrypted traffic to enhance security and reliability.

Key Components and Their Purposes
Firewalls: Serve to protect the web servers from unauthorized access by filtering incoming traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between the internal network (web servers) and the external network (internet), blocking traffic that doesn't meet security criteria.

SSL Certificate: Used to encrypt data in transit between the web servers and the external network. SSL certificates help prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data interception by ensuring that all transmitted information is encrypted, thus maintaining privacy, data integrity, and authentication.

Monitoring Clients: Deployed to continuously monitor the performance and health of the servers. These tools analyze server operations, track overall health metrics, and notify administrators of potential issues, ensuring that any performance degradation or operational anomalies are promptly addressed.

Identified Infrastructure Challenges
SSL Termination at Load Balancer: If SSL encryption is terminated at the load balancer, it means that traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is unencrypted, potentially exposing data to interception within the internal network.

Single MySQL Server: Relying on a single MySQL server poses scalability challenges and introduces a single point of failure. If this server goes down, it can disrupt the entire web service.

Homogeneous Server Components: Having identical components on all servers can lead to resource contention (CPU, Memory, I/O, etc.), negatively affecting performance. This setup complicates troubleshooting and scaling since it's more difficult to isolate problems or allocate resources efficiently.

Conclusion
While this infrastructure enhances security through the use of firewalls and SSL certificates and improves reliability through monitoring, it also faces challenges regarding data encryption continuity, scalability, and performance optimization. Addressing these issues involves implementing end-to-end encryption, considering a distributed database approach, and possibly segregating server roles to better manage resources and scaling.
